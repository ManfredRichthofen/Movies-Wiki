## Requesting Movies and TV Shows for Jellyfin
This guide will walk you through the steps to request both movies and TV shows using the web portal, integrated with your Jellyfin server. Overseerr allows users to submit requests for new content and streamlines media requests.

### Steps
1. Access the Website
Open a web browser on your device.

Go to the URL. https://requests.jfapp.xyz.

2. Log in
On the login page, enter your username and password. 
This should be the same as your jellyfin login.
If you’re logging in for the first time, you may need to create an account or request access from the server admin.
Click Login to access your account.
3. Navigate to the Movies or TV Shows Section
After logging in, you’ll land on the Overseerr dashboard.

Use the navigation menu to select either Movies or TV Shows based on your interest.

Movies Tab: Allows you to search and request films.
TV Shows Tab: Allows you to search and request television series, including entire seasons or individual episodes.
4. Search for a Title
In the selected section (Movies or TV Shows), use the search bar at the top to find the title you want to request.
Type the title and press Enter to see the results.
5. Request the Title
In the search results, locate the movie or TV show you wish to request.

Click on the title or image to open its details page.

On the details page, click the Request button.

For TV shows, you might see options to request individual seasons or specific episodes if available.
For movies, you may have the option to select different qualities or versions if the admin has enabled this feature.
Confirm your request. Overseerr will notify you that the request has been submitted.

6. Track Your Request
To view the status of your requests, navigate to the Requests tab.
Overseerr will display the request status (e.g., Pending, Approved, Available).
Once the requested content is available, it will usually show as Available in the Requests tab, and you can access it in Jellyfin.
