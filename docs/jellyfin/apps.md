#### Green/Purple Artifacts on video

Hardware decoding works for 97 percent of users and allows for greatly reduced CPU usage. If it does not work for you, follow these instructions to disable it:

Click the user icon in the top right corner. (It is the last icon.)
Click "Client Settings".
Under the "video" category, for "hardwareDecoding", select "decode.disabled".
This should eliminate video decoding glitches and unwanted green/purple colors. Note that it can increase CPU usage by up to 4 times the original usage level.
